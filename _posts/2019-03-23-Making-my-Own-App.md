As you can see by the post title I've started a new project and it's making my own app. 
With this project I'm killing two birds with one stone: I'm getting experience with Python and web frameworks.
The framework I'm using for this project is Django after making the app I also plan to make it again but with Flask.
The app I'm making is a simple to do list app that I plan to expand upon once I get the basics down.
