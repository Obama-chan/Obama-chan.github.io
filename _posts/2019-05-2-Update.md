Update time. So the python app is almost done, I had to put the project on hold for a bit as I had to focus on my classes and other personal matters.
As of right now my workload has drastically decreased, so the app will be done sooner then later. I've also decided to start seriously studying for the A+ certificate.
I feel that it would greatly help me while I'm job hunting.
