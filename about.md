Hello I'm Donovan Grant, and you're currently viewing my github pages, welcome!
I'm an FIU IT Software senior about to graduate, currently I'm job hunting and working on projects to impress employers
and also hone my programming skills.

Sidenote: I chose the name Obama-chan cause it's a funny name to me
